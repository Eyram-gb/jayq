          <span className="italic font-semibold">Jeremiah Quarshie</span> was
          born in Accra, Ghana. He lives and works in Karlsruhe, Germany.
          Quarshie obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Kwame
          Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana in
          2007.
          <br />
          Using the &lsquo;politics of painting&rsquo; and its&apos; traditional
          formalistic concerns as metaphors, he displays an acute social
          awareness in examining the connection between people who have
          previously been historically and culturally divided. These divisions
          have occurred because of social, economic or geographical conditions
          that have manifested on the African continent. Through his
          portraiture, he documents the lives of people in fabricated and
          genuine roles, using his own friends or so-called &lsquo;ordinary
          women&rsquo; who he scouted for as his painting subjects.
          Quarshie&apos;s over- arching thematic concerns pertain to concepts of
          &lsquo;hope against failing political conditions.&rsquo; With a keen
          interest in historical people and events, Quarshie makes subtle and
          sometimes bold references to such in his quest to state the recurring
          conditions and contexts that exists in different times and conditions.
          Quarshie, began exhibiting in 2007. He went on to exhibit
          internationally at Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam (SMBA), Amsterdam
          (2012) and Gallery 1957 at 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair, New
          York (2017). Quarshie has also participated in a number of shows in
          London, Munich, Marrakesh, Cape Town and Paramaribo.
          <br />
          His work forms part of numerous local and international collections
          such as, The Zeitz Musuem, Cape Town, The Harn Museum of Art, Florida,
          The Seth Dei Foundation, Accra and The World Bank Collection,
          Washington D.C. among others
